# Using Message Queue In Node
 - Here, I have used BullMQ, which is a nodejs library for message queue running on the top od redis
 - You have to have a running redis server in order to use it.
 - A very basic demo of how worker and producer works has been shown here.
 - Further, I have also used RabbitMQ in one of my projects - Reaminder_Service_MicroService which you can checkout in  my repo
